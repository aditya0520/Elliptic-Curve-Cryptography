# Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography

As a part of undergraduate research project, I analyzed the performance of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm which is used in IoT devices by testing them on varying data sizes and tracking the time to encrypt and decrypt the data.

Prime Number - 19, Private Keys - 5,7 <br/>
Encryption time for the equation:  $y^2$ =  $x^3$ + $x + 18\$
